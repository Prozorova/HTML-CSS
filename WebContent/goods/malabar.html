						During the months of June to September, India sees the monsoon season sweep through its western 
						coastal belt.  These tropical rains sweep up from the oceans around India across the south west 
						of the country. Once they reach the port of Malabar, the fun really begins. After the coffee beans 
						have been sorted for size, they are laid out on concrete patios in open-sided warehouses where 
						they are exposed to the tropical rains. They are then painstakingly raked, turned and spread for 
						12-16 weeks whist being closely monitored for size, colour and quality. Once they have adopted their 
						signature pale gold colour, they are prepared for export.
